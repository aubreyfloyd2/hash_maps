HashMap Python3 Program with two different methods for collision resolition with consideration for Big O time complexity.

Part 1 - Singly Linked List
Implement an optimized HashMap class. Use a dynamic array to store your hash table and implement chaining for collision resolution using a singly linked list. Chains of key/value pairs will be stored in linked list nodes. Implementation will include the following methods: 
  put() 
  get() 
  remove() 
  contains_key() 
  clear() 
  empty_buckets() 
  resize_table() 
  table_load() 
  get_keys() 
  find_mode()

Part 2 - Open Addressing
Implement an optimized HashMap class. Use a dynamic array to store your hash table, and implement Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing for collision resolution inside that dynamic array. Implementation will include the following methods: 
  put() 
  get() 
  remove() 
  contains_key() 
  clear() 
  empty_buckets() 
  resize_table() 
  table_load() 
  get_keys() 
  __iter__()
  __next__()
